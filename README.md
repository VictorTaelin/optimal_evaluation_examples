# HVM is an optimal discrete computer

- Massive parallelism is just one aspect

- Major potential lies on optimal evaluation

    - DUP Nodes = magically fast composition

    - SUP Nodes = magically fast search

- Still not fully understood

## Potential AI application?

- 1. Select a discrete AI architecture (which?)

- 2. Improve it via optimal evaluation (DUPs & SUPs)

- 3. Scale it with massive parallelism (on CPUs?)

- 4. ???

- 5. Who knows
